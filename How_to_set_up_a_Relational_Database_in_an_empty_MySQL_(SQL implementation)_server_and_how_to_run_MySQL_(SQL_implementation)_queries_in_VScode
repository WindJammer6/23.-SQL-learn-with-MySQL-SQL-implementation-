How to set up the 'movies' Relational Database provided by codebasics in the Youtube video titled: 'SQL Tutorial for 
Beginners | MySQL Tutorial' in an empty MySQL (SQL implementation) connection/server?
There is 2 ways to do this:
1. Manually import the data to the MySQL (SQL implementation) Workbench - Watch the timestep from 5:56 to 13:05 of the 
   Youtube video by codebasics titled 'SQL Tutorial for Beginners | MySQL Tutorial' 
   (link: https://youtu.be/Rm0xH2Vpfi0?si=QVr3mUdqUGLHN84R) 
2. Directly run the 'SQL_query_that_creates_the_movies_relational_database_in_a_MySQL_server.sql' file as a query in 
   the established connection of the MySQL (SQL implementation) connection/server in VScode (this file consists of 
   many MySQL (SQL implementation) queries, which you will hopefully be able to understand most of it after completing 
   these tutorials (though some of the MySQL (SQL implementation) queries will not be gone through in these tutorials, 
   they can be quickly understood with some Googling))
(Note: You can view how the 'movies' Relational Database provided by codebasics in the Youtube video titled: 'SQL 
       Tutorial for Beginners | MySQL Tutorial', looks like in Microsoft Excel with the file: 'movies_relational_
       database_visual_in_Microsoft_Excel.xlsx')
