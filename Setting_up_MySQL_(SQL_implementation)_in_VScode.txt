Setting up MySQL (SQL implementation) in VScode (in Windows):
There are a few steps to do this:
1. Open Visual Studio Code and Install the 'MySQL'(SQL implementation) Extension, by Jun Han. 


2. Download MySQL (SQL implementation) via the official MySQL website: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/ (MySQL)


3. Follow the steps in this video which contains clear instructions to download MySQL (SQL implementation) from 
   the official MySQL website: https://youtu.be/Rm0xH2Vpfi0?si=QVr3mUdqUGLHN84R (codebasics) (Youtube video titled: 
   'SQL Tutorial for Beginners | MySQL Tutorial', but just watch from 0:00 to 4:30 of the video, which explains 
   how to download MySQL (SQL implementation) from the official MySQL website)

   (IMPORTANT NOTE: 
   One thing that you need to do differently from the video is that, at 3:33, the video is at the 'Authetication 
   Method' page of the MySQL (SQL implementation) installation process. 
   
   Instead of immediately skipping to the next page of the installation process as shown by the video, check the 
   other box in this 'Authetication Method' page of the MySQL (SQL implementation) installation process, 'Use 
   Legacy Authentication Method'. This action was not shown in the video.

   This is because, in step 4, if this action is done, attempt to establish a connection link between VScode and 
   MySQL connections/servers (which stores databases) will fail, and you will get this error in VScode:
   Error: 'ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE'. But by doing this action, you will be able to troubleshoot this bug.

   (superuser)
   )

   Once you have managed to successfully download MySQL (SQL implementation), a MySQL-specific MySQL (SQL 
   implementation) server management tool/IDE/application will pop up, called 'MySQL Workbench', which is where you 
   can not only work with databases in MySQL (SQL implementation) connections/servers (which stores databases), but 
   also view/create/edit/manage MySQL (SQL implementation) connections/servers (which stores databases).



4. After downloading MySQL (SQL implementation), in order to establish a connection link between VScode and 
   MySQL connections/servers (which stores databases), you can follow the steps in this website, which contains
   clear instructions to establish a connection link between VScode and MySQL connections/servers (which stores 
   databases): https://guidingcode.com/use-mysql-with-visual-studio-code/ (GuidingCode) (just see 'Step 3' in
   this website will do)
