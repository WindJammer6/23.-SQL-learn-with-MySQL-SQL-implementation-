The '1. MySQL (SQL implementation) basic syntax' tutorial folder and '2. MySQL (SQL implementation) modifying Relational 
Databases' tutorial folder are following from this Youtube playlist: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41lfR-6DnOokmJfmYj2hdVMKVGIcF7__ (Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 
'MySQL for Beginners')


Note that while in the Youtube video by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used MAMP and PHP as the
IDE, I used VScode instead.

Deviations of these tutorials from the Youtube playlist by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners':
- In the Youtube video by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used MAMP and PHP as the
  IDE, but I used VScode instead (refer to the file 'Setting_up_MySQL_(SQL_implementation)_in_VScode.txt' for how to set 
  up MySQL with VScode).
- In the Youtube video by Quentin Watt Tutorials, titled 'MySQL for Beginners' used a pre-made Relational Database by 
  Quentin, but I used a 'movies' Relational Database provided by codebasics in their Youtube video, titled 'SQL Tutorial 
  for Beginners | MySQL Tutorial' (link: https://youtu.be/Rm0xH2Vpfi0?si=QVr3mUdqUGLHN84R)

The '3. MySQL (SQL implementation) integrated with Python (as backend) using PyMySQL (Python library)' tutorial folder
is following from these Youtube videos: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vsC05rxZ8c&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-l5kVSNVKGO60V6RkXAVtp-&index=1 (Youtube video by
Tech with Tim, titled: 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Setup & Basic Queries (w/ MySQL Connector)') and 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91iNR0eG8kE&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-l5kVSNVKGO60V6RkXAVtp-&index=2 (Youtube video by
Tech with Tim, titled: 'Python MySQL Tutorial - Creating Tables, Inserting & Selecting')


Note that while these tutorials from the Youtube videos by Tech with Tim used the 'mysql.connector' (Python library), 
but it dosen't work for my computer for some reason so I used the PyMySQL (Python library) instead, which works for my 
computer and is relatively similar to the 'mysql.connector' (Python library) in functionality and syntax.
