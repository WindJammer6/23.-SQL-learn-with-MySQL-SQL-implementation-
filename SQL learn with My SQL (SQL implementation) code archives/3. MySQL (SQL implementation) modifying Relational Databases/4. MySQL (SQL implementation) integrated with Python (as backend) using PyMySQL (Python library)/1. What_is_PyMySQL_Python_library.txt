What is the PyMySQL Python library?
PyMySQL is a pure-Python MySQL client library that allows developers to connect to a MySQL (SQL implementation) 
Relational Database (aka SQL Database) from a Python application. It provides an interface for interacting with 
MySQL (SQL implementation) Relational Databases (aka SQL Databases) using Python, allowing you to execute MySQL 
(SQL implementation) queries, retrieve data, and perform database operations in Python.


In this short tutorial, I will only be demonstrating the baisc Python code template to use PyMySQL (Python 
library) to execute MySQL (SQL implementation) queries.

(Note: These tutorials used the 'mysql.connector' (Python library), but it dosen't work for my computer for some
 reason so I used the PyMySQL (Python library) instead, which works for my computer and is relatively similar to 
 the 'mysql.connector' (Python library) in functionality and syntax)
